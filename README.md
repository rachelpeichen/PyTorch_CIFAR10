## PyTorch_CIFAR10

:sunglasses: *Note: this project was originated to be a sharing to my lab partners. If you're interested, you can refer to my [slide](https://github.com/rachelpeichen/PyTorch_CIFAR10/blob/main/Implement%20of%20CNN%20via%20PyToch.pdf).*

### :small_blue_diamond: Training an image classifier via PyTorch
This is an implement of official example provided on PyTorch official website.
You can refer to the official tutorial [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html).

For this project, we will use the CIFAR10 dataset which has 10 classes:

The images in CIFAR-10 dataset are of size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.

### :small_blue_diamond: The implement steps in order:

1. Load and normalizing the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using torchvision

2. Define a Convolutional Neural Network

3. Define a loss function and an optimizer

4. Train the network on the training data

5. Test the network on the test data


### :small_blue_diamond: Achieved Goal

:ballot_box_with_check:  Understanding PyTorchâ€™s Tensor library and neural networks at a high level.

:ballot_box_with_check:  Train a small neural network to classify images.
